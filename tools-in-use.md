# Tools in Use

Before we get started, here is an overview of the tools we are going to cover and how will they play in each chapter. 

## From Excel to Python or R

The tools we will use are **Excel** and **Python \(or R\)**, and before you feel intimidated by the potential programming content ahead, I have to clarify that I _do not_  intend to teach you how to code or program. Instead, we will focus on getting the concept and process correctly first, and then, if you will, learning how to leverage scripts to make the process even more efficient.

So each topic in this book should generally follow the structure below:

1. Explain the concept 
2. Use Excel to illustrate the concept and bring up related applications
3. Use Python or R to push the boundary a bit further

I hope this structure would help readers better understand the concepts and their applications, and why sometimes we do or do not need programming. I personally hold a neutral view on Excel as I understand it's vital and familiar to many people in the business world, so I will try to explain the most important things within that scope. Once you get the idea, please don't hesitate to level up your skillset.

## Setting up the environment for Python or R

If you do want to explore the content in Python or R, please make sure to set up the environement on your computer correctly. Following is one of the easiest ways to install the tools mostly on the user level, but feel free to configure your own integrated development environment \(IDE\).

### Python

1. Download and install [Anaconda _Python 3.7_](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) following the instructions on [conda.io](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html). It will include most of the tools and packages required for data analytics work.
2. Launch the Anaconda Navigator. In the Home tab are the available tools, and in the Environments are the available environments and packages.
3. \(Optional\) It is recommended to set up your own environment to manage each project or task, as explained in great detail by Gergely Szerovay [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c). You may just use the default "root" environment to walk through examples this book.
4. Launch **spyder** and **notebook** from the Home tab. Both of them can be used to execute the code mentioned in this book. 
5. For the first-timers, the official documentation [_Jupyter Notebook Basics_](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) is a great resource to help you get started. The walkthrough in this book will generally follow the codeblock-documentation format in the notebook.

### R

1. Download and install R from [one of the CRAN mirrors](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). This step will require system privilege. 
2. Download and install [RStudio Desktop Open Source version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). This can be done on the user level.
3. Launch RStudio and create an __**R Notebook** from the File menu.
4. The official documentation [_R Notebooks_](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks) is also a great place to get started. The examples on this site will also follow the silimar format.
