# Hello, Business World

Hello everyone, this is Jimmy. _Intro to Business Analytics_ is a collection of notes that explains and demonstrates the fundamental analytical skills that can boost the efficiency in some common business use cases, such as cleaning data in a lengthy spreadsheet, or create \(interactive\) visualizations that are easy to maintain.

In short, my goal is to help you minimize the manual efforts on dealing with the data, and start to think like a data professional. 

The topics are mainly based on my brief consulting career so far and do not contain any confidential and/or client information. Should there be any questions or suggestions, please feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imjmln/).

Jimmy
